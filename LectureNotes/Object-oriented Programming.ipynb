    "### Why to have `set` and `get` ?\n",
    "- **you can hide the implementation from your user**. Perhaps, originally, a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.\n",
    "- There are some drawbacks to accessing attributes directly versus writing a method for accessing attributes.\n",
    "    - e.g. Changing values via a method gives you more flexibility in the long-term. What if the units of measurement change, like if the store was originally meant to work in US dollars and now has to handle Euros?\n",

    "```python\n",
    "shirt_one.price = 10 # US dollars\n",
